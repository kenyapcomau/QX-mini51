# Additional information

An introduction article can be found on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/170540-adventures-with-a-stc89c52-development-board).

The files ending in .EN have been put through a translator so that the comments can be read in English. Please do not compile these versions as the translator has added spaces in various places making the program syntactically wrong. I cannot guarantee that other errors have not crept in. It's intended for only humans to read.

There is now [another repository](https://github.com/kenyapcomau/QX-mini51-SDCC) with the same programs translated for compilation with SDCC.
